        <div class="text">Hi there, my name is Lily.I came to the RSPCA as a stray, but after much hope from the RSPCA staff, sadly my old owners never came to reclaim me. Now I am looking for a new home to call my own.I am more of a independent lady who needs a quiet household to settle into. I can get spooked my loud noises so lots of hidey holes and a safe place for me to hide into would be great. This just makes sure I feel safe and secure in my new home. I am not a fan of other cats so I must be the only cat in the household. Can you blame me though? I just want to be the princess of the household and be treated like royalty. I would need to be an indoor only cat, so I can have all of the attention in my new home. I would like for my new home to have all of my favorite things, like soft blankets and nice tall cat trees and even better a radio for cat classical music! I may not be the cat who likes to be picked up but my personality will come out over time.</div>

        <div class="text">Hello we have been waiting to meet you, My name's Leo and this is my friend Lana! We are BFFs who cannot stand to be separated, so are looking for an owner who will take us both together. Lana is a lot more confident than me, I require a lot more time to warm up to people. We have been indoor only cats and have never been outside so we need a home that will continue to keep us as indoor only cats. Since we can be shy at first we need a very quiet home with no young children.</div>
