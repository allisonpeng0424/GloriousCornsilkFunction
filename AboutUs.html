    <div class="title">Who we are?</div>
    <div class="text">The RSPCA in Australia is a federation, with an RSPCA in each state and territory and RSPCA Australia as the national body. The state and territory member Societies provide services to animals in need through their shelters and inspectorates.</div>
    <div class="text">In the national office, RSPCA Australia works to influence animal welfare policy, practice and legislation across the country. We do this through various avenues, including working with government and industries, communicating and contributing to animal welfare science, running the RSPCA Approved Farming Scheme, and working with supporters through targeted advocacy and education campaigns.</div>

        <div class="desc2">
          The RSPCA offers a number of services which assist in caring for animals and provide relevant information and advice to help educate the community on animal welfare issues and concerns<br>
          For most animals that find their way to an RSPCA shelter, it is the beginning of a new life. It's where we rescue, rehabilitate and rehome.<br>
          To find out more, visit your state or territory RSPCAâ€™s website.
